CODE-N-BLOG
===========  

I want to create a blog.  
I also want to create a blog tutorial on how to code a blog.  

I will use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)  
I will use [express](http://expressjs.com/)  
I will use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)   
I will use [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)  
I will use [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/)  
... this list will expand as things get more 'interesting'.

This is my 'How to code a blog tutorial'.  
There are many like it, but this one is mine.
